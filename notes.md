    - playable game 
    - game over condition
    - restart button
    - alerts to notify who won when condition met

    - board
    - restart button 
js 
    - click handlers for board & button
    - game reset
    - win/draw detection
css
    - nothing fancy, let's just align the square board properly for now 

Is this a good starting point?
